### Hey, I'm Parth ðŸ¦•
**I'm a designer and engineer, and I build products for the internet.** 

usually at my terminal with coffee and headphones â€” writing `next` / `go` / `python`, burning llm tokens, designing unnamed figma layers, or day-trading. also into surfing, boxing, and hiking (but rarely in that order).

always looking for new projects to collab on, so drop me a message wherever.
